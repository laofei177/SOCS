# SOCS
Self-Organized Criticality Sonification

There are various samples of `SOCS` output. The first, `normal.wav` shows 'normal' running
in which the log returns of the bytes/packets sent/received show the network
continuing in a meta-stable state. 

Files beginning `spike2` are sonifications of traffic with two noticeable spikes in the
log return values. Files with a suffix `_a` are outputs of the system using absolute 
(unsigned) log return values (the default is to use signed values). The suffix `_s`
denotes that squared log returns were used. The suffixes `_1s` and `20ms` denote
the system was running at an inter-record interval of 1 s and 20 ms respectively. The traffic
for these files can be seen in the screen shot `spike2_s.png`.

Files beginning `multiSpike` are renderings of the traffic segment seen the in screen shot
`multiSpike_s.png`.

The file `screenShotActive.png` shows the whole GUI.

## Data Set Used
The examples below were generated by running `SOCS` on the `bd-1015440483-eth1-interpolated-event.csv` dump file
available from Imperial College's [Quaint project](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~uh/QUAINT/data/).

## Sounds Used
The sounds used in these examples were a combination of recorded natural sounds downloaded 
from <http://www.freesfx.co.uk>. The synthesized rain sound is based on a patch made
by Andy Farnell for his book [Designing Sound](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/designing-sound).


The `Sent_Bytes` channel used an edited loop taken from the [Stream 002](http://www.freesfx.co.uk/rx2/mp3s/4/4343_1329751803.mp3) 
sound effect.

The `Sent_Packets` channel used an edited loop taken from the [Country Sounds](http://www.freesfx.co.uk/rx2/mp3s/9/10048_1361187216.mp3)
sound effect.

The `Received_Bytes` channel used an edited loop taken from the [Vientos](http://www.freesfx.co.uk/rx2/mp3s/9/10856_1384707240.mp3)
wind recording.

The `Received_Packets` channel used a version of Andy Farnell's rain sound.
